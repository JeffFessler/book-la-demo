p72
If …(V’)… represents counter-clockwise…, then …(V)… must represent clockwise…
Here, counter-clockwise and clockwise are swapped.

p112 Fact 4.20: 𝐅 should be 𝔽

p113 Eqn. (4.27): 𝐅 should be 𝔽

p215 Eqn. (6.72): 𝒫_n should be 𝒫_N

p216 Eqn. (6.73): 𝒫_n should be 𝒫_K

p216 Eqn. (6.73): k(n) should be p(k)

p228 Example 6.21: B₁'B₂ should be 1/√2 [1 1; 1 -1]

p246 Frobenious should be Frobenius

p265 Eqn. (7.40): β* should be defined as minimizer of SURE(β).
Then by (7.39) this is approximately the minimizer of the MSE.

p301 nonnnegative should be nonnegative

p354 Eqn. (9.44) is missing the "3" in "3/32" in the numerator

p399 Eqn. (12.26): the first σ₊ should be σ₋ instead.
