p72
If …(V’)… represents counter-clockwise…, then …(V)… must represent clockwise…
Here, counter-clockwise and clockwise are swapped.

p109 Definition of row space should be ℛ(A^⊤) instead of ℛ(A')

p112 Fact 4.20: 𝐅 should be 𝔽

p113 Eqn. (4.27): 𝐅 should be 𝔽

p215 Eqn. (6.72): 𝒫_n should be 𝒫_N

p216 Eqn. (6.73): 𝒫_n should be 𝒫_K

p216 Eqn. (6.73): k(n) should be p(k)

p228 Example 6.21: B₁'B₂ should be 1/√2 [1 1; 1 -1]

p246 Frobenious should be Frobenius

p265 Eqn. (7.40): β* should be defined as minimizer of SURE(β).
Then by (7.39) this is approximately the minimizer of the MSE.

p301 nonnnegative should be nonnegative

p306 "irreducibly diagonally dominant" should have been
[defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diagonally_dominant_matrix#Variations).

p354 Eqn. (9.44) is missing the "3" in "3/32" in the numerator

p399 Eqn. (12.26): the first σ₊ should be σ₋ instead.
